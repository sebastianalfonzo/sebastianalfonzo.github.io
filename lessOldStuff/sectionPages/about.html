      My name is Sebastian Manuel Del Valle Alfonzo Manzo. I was born in Valencia, Venezuela. When I was five years old, my family migrated to Saint Paul, Minnesota’s Midway neighborhood. Growing up, I organized a weekly teen night at Hancock Recreation Center, advocated for expanded public transit access for students, and produced video and print journalism.<br><br>
I discovered my love for art and communications in college. At the University of Minnesota, I balanced directing the Wake Student Art Magazine’s multimedia department, producing digital content for the College of Science and Engineering, and a full course load of art, literature, and theory classes. I graduated with a BA in Cultural Studies, Comparative Literature, and Cinema in the spring of 2021.<br><br>
Since graduating, I’ve been working as an archivist, second camera, and production assistant for a PBS Frontline documentary film about public safety in Minneapolis. I  have also been working as a communicator and organizer for Serpentina Arts: a collective of Latinx visual artists with an emphasis on professional development and community networking.<br><br>
I am interested in working between digital and analog means of both still and moving image making. My art is a vehicle for reflection, exploration, and documentation of my experiences. It is also a means of connecting with my community and learning from it. Making art has catalyzed some of the most meaningful conversations, moments, and relationships in my life.<br><br>
Thank you for visiting my digital space and taking a moment to learn about me. If you would like to connect, feel free to email me at sebastianalfonzomanzo@gmail.com, or send me a message on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/alfonzomanzo/" style="color: #3D7AB8;">instagram: @alfonzomanzo</a>.
